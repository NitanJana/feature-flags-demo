# Feature Flags Demo

## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags (also known as feature toggles or feature switches) are a software development technique that allows developers to enable or disable functionality remotely without deploying new code. They decouple feature release from code deployment, giving you more control over the full lifecycle of features.

Key benefits include:

- Safely deploy code to production that is not yet ready for users
- Gradually roll out features to specific user segments
- A/B testing of features
- Quickly disable problematic features without a new deployment
- Manage feature lifecycles independently from code deployments

## About This Demo

This project demonstrates how to implement and manage feature flags in a modern web application. It showcases various use cases for feature flags including:

- Conditional rendering of UI components
- Enabling/disabling features for specific users or user groups
- Managing feature rollouts
- Feature flag administration interface

## Tech Stack

This demo is built with the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications
- **React**: UI library for building component-based interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Static type-checking for JavaScript
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Feature Flag Management**: Custom implementation with configuration options
